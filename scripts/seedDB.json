To the left, we see the tip of a steeple and to the right a figure in blue on a white horse, perhaps returning to his cottage as lowering clouds threaten the onset of a storm. Rousseau often chose to represent rustic cottages, informed both by sites he had seen on his travels and his familiarity with the 17th-century Dutch tradition. The location of the site depicted here is uncertain. It is possible that it could be a rocky plain in the forest of Fontainebleau some two miles south-west of Barbizon, which Rousseau represented frequently, particularly in his later years. However, it is also quite possible that Rousseau did not intend here to represent a specific location but rather a more generalized and imaginative interpretation of nature.",

He left his native Baltimore to study at the Düsseldorf Academy and remained abroad most of his brief career. Woodville, however, occasionally returned to Baltimore for family visits and continued to send pictures to New York to be exhibited at the Art Union. Tragically, he died at the early age of 31, a victim of an overdose of drugs.\r\n\r\nIn this scene, a young soldier narrates his experiences to an elderly couple. Above them hangs a leg-of-mutton hat, a musket, and a picture-all allusions to the Revolutionary War.\r\n\r\nFive years later, the artist developed this composition into Old '76 and Young '48 (Walters 37.2370).\r\n",

How different with these Lakes and Mountains;- although they have been in existence thousands of years, what a freshness and newness rests over them,- they are veriably the same yesterday, to-day, and forever to all appearances.  The scene in the sketch presents a broad sheet of water,- and the foreground wild and broken;- with a solitary horseman climbing the hill from the valley below;- lofty promontories flank the sides; carrying the eye to a noble line of mountains in the distance, broken against the sky with spurs & pinnacles.\" A.J.

            "Description": "Léon Bonvin was born in Vaugirard, just outside Paris in 1834. Despite displaying great talent in the medium of watercolor he was largely unrecognized by his contemporaries. In 1866 he hanged himself at the age of 32, apparently due to financial difficulties. Working at his family's bar or \"cabaret,\" he sketched and painted watercolors only in his spare moments, yet in the seven year period between 1859 and his death he created numerous exquisite still lifes of flowers and fruits, and subtle landscapes capturing fleeting atmospheric effects. There is evidence that, despite his rural home, Bonvin did have knowledge of the art world in Paris. His half-brother was the better known artist, François Bonvin. In addition Bonvin's still lifes show the influence of Jean-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779), whose work was undergoing a revival in the 1850s and 60s.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century an appreciation of Bonvin's work was confined to a small circle of connoisseurs and collectors, most prominent among them William T. Walters, father of Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum. For much of the 19th century William displayed and stored his watercolors in a deluxe leather-bound album with a specially commissioned frontispiece and tailpiece by the renowned flower painter of the Lyon school, Jean-Marie Reignier (see WAM 37.1501 and 37. 1531). William's collection of Bonvin's work was acquired between 1862 and 1891, and eventually comprised 56 watercolors and one, rare oil; today, this is the largest collection of Bonvin's work in existence. \r\n",

On reaching a proper distance, a signal is given and they all start at once with frightful yells, & commence racing around the herd, drawing their circle closer and closer, until the whol body is huddled together in confusion.  Now they begin firing, and as this throws them into a headlong panic and furious rage, each man selects his animal, wheeling and coursing through the affrighted herd;- the dexterity and grace of the Indians and the thousands upon thousands of Buffalo moving in every direction over an illimitable prairie form a scene altogether, that in the whole world beside, cannot be matched.\" A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",

He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).\r\n\r\n\"Incident of a voyage to N. Orleans off Cape Hatteras in a storm. Capt [loqr] - 'Mate? I say Mate!'

The grass is quite sufficient without any other provender to keep the animals in good condition, if the work given them to do is not too heavy, or if they are not compedlled to make forced marches.  The selection of the Camp is of so much importance that scouts are sent out previous to the halt of the Caravan, whose duty it is to select sites combining above all things the two great requisites, an abundance of both water & grass.\" A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",

Although it was the month of August, we had frequent snow and hail storms, and towards evening thick overcoats were almost indispensable to comfort.  In the morning one or two of the hunters would e dispatched for mountain sheep, or any other game of a size to warrant a shot, for powder and ball are precious articles here and not to be wasted: others would scramble out on the rocks to catch the finny-tribe, not solely for amusement,- no indeed!- keen appetites and insatiable maws were in expectancy, and always ready to do justice to either fish or flesh, with a blazing fire burning briskly, 'in case (as Wilkins Micawber, has it) anything should turn up.' After the meal we could then sit patiently and listen to some Trappers relating reminiscences of his adventures,- his huntings, and fighting with the Indians, and his loves with Indian beauties forming the principal ground work of his narrative.\" A.J. Miller, extracted from \"The West of Alfred Jacob Miller\" (1837).\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",

The french pantomimes performed in multiple theatres in Baltimore. The shows included tight-rope dancing, ballet, and balancing acts in addition to the pantomime. The plots were so complex they were compared to those of the Italian Opera. As someone who frequented the shows, Miller has provided a view that is almost otherwise unrecorded.",

They are of all imaginable shapes, as if nature had been in eccentric and merry mood;- taking care however to have the centre of gravity fall is such a manner as to combine the most complete solidity with the utmost strength.  They will be as they are now when the great pyramids of Egypt are forgotten;- with the proviso whoever of 'Ochiltree' in the 'Antiquary,' 'Yemaun keep hands and gunpowther frae them.'  Of what possible use can they be? With a telescope you can see the mountain sheep looking complacently on us,- they scale these dizzy heights with ease and defy us to follow,- this is the use to them.  At night (if they discover no enemy near) the flock descends for food and drink, and by daylight return to the tops of thes impregnable forts, where they sleep secure.  Trappers state that when two males from opposite directions meet on a narrow ledge of rock neither make way, but give battle and continue it, until one or the other is thrown down.\"   A.J.

This watercolor demonstrates well Barye's idiosyncratic technique of building up his surfaces in a manner similar to the way he built up clay in his sculptures. The analogy between his watercolors and sculptures was noted by several contemporary commentators. Philippe Burty, for example, likened his watercolors to \"painted low reliefs,\" (\"Ventes d'Aquarelles, de Dessins et de Tableaux,\" Gazette des Beaux-Arts, February 1, 1859). Here, Barye uses a scraper to render the whiskers and mane of the lion in a \"sgraffito\" technique, while his fingerprints are discernible in a passage of pink watercolor at top right.",

He filled many journals with drawings and captions from the time he was studying in Paris and Rome (1833) until the 1870's.  In 1969 a collection of 100 of these sketches was generously donated to the Walters Art Museum by J. William Middendorf II. The interests of Miller are clearly reflected in these sketches: the theater (a large portion being quick figure drawings of the Ravel Pantomime Troupe), childhood memories, Baltimore scenery, and witty scenes of characters.  (See The Walters Art Gallery Bulletin, April, 1969, Vol. 21, No. 7, Pages 3-4).\r\n\r\n\"A Stickler for the letter of the Law. - 'Carry me to prison' 'Carry me did you say' 'Blur Nouns [?]' 'I won't stir a ha'porth - Let's see you carry me, Ye bloody thafe of the woruld.\" -Miller",

            "Description": "Léon Bonvin was born in Vaugirard, just outside Paris in 1834. Despite displaying great talent in the medium of watercolor he was largely unrecognized by his contemporaries. In 1866 he hanged himself at the age of 32, apparently due to financial difficulties. Working at his family's bar or \"cabaret,\" he sketched and painted watercolors only in his spare moments, yet in the seven year period between 1859 and his death he created numerous exquisite still lifes of flowers and fruits, and subtle landscapes capturing fleeting atmospheric effects. There is evidence that, despite his rural home, Bonvin did have knowledge of the art world in Paris. His half-brother was the better known artist, François Bonvin. In addition Bonvin's still lifes show the influence of Jean-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779), whose work was undergoing a revival in the 1850s and 60s.\r\n\r\nDuring the 19th century an appreciation of Bonvin's work was confined to a small circle of connoisseurs and collectors, most prominent among them William T. Walters, father of Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum. For much of the 19th century William displayed and stored his watercolors in a deluxe leather-bound album with a specially commissioned frontispiece and tailpiece by the renowned flower painter of the Lyon school, Jean-Marie Reignier (see WAM 37.1501 and 37. 1531). William's collection of Bonvin's work was acquired between 1862 and 1891, and eventually comprised 56 watercolors and one, rare oil; today, this is the largest collection of Bonvin's work in existence.",

            "Description": "South Pass, or the Continental Divide, was the gateway to Oregon and California.  The southwestern desert was not yet as fully explored as the Midwest, and so the trail along the Platte became the favored route.  Discovered in 1812, the pass remained unknown to Anglo-Americans until a group of Crow Indians told Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick about it in 1824.  After William H. Ashley started the rendezvous system in 1825, Fitzpatrick and others used South Pass as the entrance to the best beaver country in the mountains.\r\n\r\nHere Miller pictures the frenzy that possessed the men as they neared the fresh water.  The Indians, watching in contempt, Miller suggested, had much the same attitude as did Captain Stewart, who would not run his horse for the water but walked casually along as if he did not feel the same thirst that possessed the men.\r\n\r\nIn July 1858 William T. Walters commissioned 200 watercolors at twelve dollars apiece from Baltimore born artist Alfred Jacob Miller. These paintings were each accompanied by a descriptive text, and were delivered in installments over the next twenty-one months and ultimately were bound in three albums. Transcriptions of field-sketches drawn during the 1837 expedition that Miller had undertaken to the annual fur-trader's rendezvous in the Green River Valley (in what is now western Wyoming), these watercolors are a unique record of the closing years of the western fur trade.",
